I always plan on creating a blog to share my work. Work meaning all the tech presentations, tutorials, research work and findings I made in the past years and the coming future. I’ve been keeping on my hard disk to rot some of my precious hard work and I believe it’s time to share it to the community. 

I was really energise to start this blog after my attendance to Google I/O 2016. The energetic and vibrant community vibe pushed me further to do more. And yes even with the huge task I carry now, I can still do more.

I always believe in people and the way to change the world begins with your will. Your will to make a change, your will to bring knowledge to those who are not privileged and converting this will into actions that impact others. I always measure success not by fame and money but the number of people you touched, inspired and helped.

This is the start and I hope you find treasures of knowledge (hopefully) in my blog.
